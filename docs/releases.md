# Releases

Exams are on-demand - there can be no deploy freeze.

Every app that builds is its own release-please component.

Consider release service to perform smart releases - `rApp`

One environment for now, `production`. Staging and promotion between environments come later.

Flow: merge to `main` → release-please keeps one release PR per app → merge a release PR → [`release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml) creates the GitHub release, builds the app's image at the release commit, pushes it to DOCR and records its digest → `production` approval → Komodo deploys that digest.

## Apps

| App                  | Ships as                                                     | Version files release-please bumps                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auth-api`           | Image → Komodo stack `exam-platform-auth-api`                | `Cargo.toml`, root `Cargo.lock`                               |
| `curriculum-api`     | Image → `exam-platform-curriculum-api`                       | `Cargo.toml`, root `Cargo.lock`                               |
| `examiner-dashboard` | Image (client + server) → `exam-platform-examiner-dashboard` | `server/Cargo.toml`, `client/package.json`, root `Cargo.lock` |
| `web-app`            | Image (Caddy serving `dist/`) → `exam-platform-web-app`      | `package.json`                                                |
| `desktop-app`        | Tauri bundles: the release job is a stub                     | `package.json`, `backend/Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`            |

- Config: one per app, [`release-please/<app>.json`](../release-please), with its manifest `release-please/<app>.manifest.json`. Apps with a Dockerfile ship as images.
- Tags `<app>-v<version>`, changelog `apps/<app>/CHANGELOG.md`. Each manifest starts its app at `0.0.0` (unreleased), so its first release is `0.1.0`.
- `feat` bumps minor, `fix`/`perf`/`revert` patch, breaking changes minor while below 1.0. `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test` and `build` release nothing: a dependency bump that should ship is `fix(deps): …`.

## Release roots

release-please gives a package the commits that touch files under its path. Each app's config holds a single package at the repo root (`.`), so it sees every commit, minus its `exclude-paths`: the other apps, and the directories no build reads (`.github`, `.vscode`, `databases`, `deploy`, `docs`, `release-please`). The changelog, tag and version files still point into `apps/<app>`.

- A change outside the excluded directories releases the app. A `libs/runtime` fix releases aAPI, cAPI, eDd and dApp; wApp also excludes `libs`.
- release-please excludes directories, not files. A commit that touches only root files, such as `Cargo.lock`, `bun.lock` or `package.json`, releases every app. Over-releasing redeploys an unchanged app; under-releasing would leave a fix unshipped.
- A new app needs its own config and manifest, a step in `release.yml`, and an entry in the other apps' `exclude-paths`. A new top-level directory counts toward every app until each config excludes it.

## CI

[`ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on PRs and on `main`; path filters pick the jobs, and `CI passed` is the single check to require.

- Rust runs on any stable toolchain. `rust-toolchain.toml` names the `stable` channel, not a version, so rustup uses the stable toolchain already installed: locally, yours; in CI, the runner image's, never a newer one. Images build on `rust:1`, the newest stable. `rust-version = "1.95"` in both workspaces is the floor they all meet.
- Rust: `cargo fmt`, Clippy (workspace, and `runtime` without `server` as dApp builds it), tests.
- Desktop Rust: the same for dApp's own workspace.
- Bun: frozen install, `bun run check`, `bun run build`.
- Docker: builds each image whose inputs changed, without pushing: the app's directory, plus what its Dockerfile copies from outside it (`Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `libs/`, `package.json`, `bun.lock`, `.dockerignore`). `main` writes the layer cache that PRs read.

## Release

[`release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml) on every push to `main`:

1. release-please runs once per app config. It opens or updates the app's release PR, and creates the GitHub release when that PR was just merged. Releases made with `GITHUB_TOKEN` trigger no other workflow, so the same run continues. One config failing still lets the other apps' releases build; the job fails afterwards.
2. Per released image app, [`release-container.yml`](../.github/workflows/release-container.yml) checks out the release commit and builds the existing repo-root Docker context. It pushes `registry.digitalocean.com/<DOCR_REGISTRY>/<app>:<version>` and `:sha-<commit>`, attests build provenance, and appends `**Image:** <repository>@sha256:…` to the release notes.
3. [`deploy.yml`](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml) waits for `production` approval, then runs Komodo's deploy Action with that digest. Deploys of one app run one at a time; a newer pending deploy supersedes an older one.

## Deploy

Production is one DigitalOcean Droplet running Komodo, Caddy and the app stacks ([`deploy/README.md`](../deploy/README.md)). [`deploy/exam-platform.toml`](../deploy/exam-platform.toml) is Komodo's Resource Sync:

- Stacks `exam-platform-<app>` on server `exam-platform`. Each runs `apps/<app>/compose.yaml` from `main`, the same file developers run locally, with `IMAGE` set to the release digest. Komodo pulls the image first, and `--no-build` keeps compose from building `main` instead.
- All stacks join network `platform`, which `pre_deploy` creates if missing. Caddy reaches the public apps there by alias.
- `compose up --wait --wait-timeout 120`: a container that does not turn healthy fails the deploy.
- Action `exam-platform-deploy` keeps three Variables per app:
  - `EXAM_PLATFORM_<APP>_IMAGE`: what the stack's environment runs. Set before each deploy, so it may hold an image that never turned healthy.
  - `EXAM_PLATFORM_<APP>_IMAGE_HEALTHY`: the last image a deploy confirmed healthy. Set only after Komodo reports the deploy succeeded.
  - `EXAM_PLATFORM_<APP>_IMAGE_PREVIOUS`: the healthy image before that one, for `previous`.
- The Action decides from Komodo's record of the deploy, not from its own requests. It retries reads and Variable writes, keeps polling through errors, and looks the deploy up when the request itself failed.
  - Unhealthy, or never started: it redeploys `_IMAGE_HEALTHY`, and the workflow still fails.
  - No result within 420s: it fails without rolling back, since the deploy may still be running or may have succeeded. Check the stack in Komodo.
- Only admins can write Komodo Variables. The Action runs as Komodo's admin Action user, so the CI key holds Execute on that Action and nothing else (user group `exam-platform-ci`).
- Runtime secrets are Komodo secret Variables, interpolated into stack environments at deploy. They never reach images or this repository.
- Procedure `exam-platform-prune-images` removes unused images every Sunday. A rollback pulls its image from DOCR again.

Rollback:

- Actions → Deploy → Run workflow, with the app and `previous`, or with any digest from a release's **Image** line. `previous` deploys `_IMAGE_PREVIOUS`, and on success swaps it with `_IMAGE_HEALTHY`.
- Without GitHub: set `EXAM_PLATFORM_<APP>_IMAGE` in Komodo, then deploy the stack. Once it is healthy, set `_IMAGE_HEALTHY` to the same digest: the next failed deploy rolls back to it. Komodo runs Actions from the UI without arguments, so the Action cannot do this.
- Stacks read `compose.yaml` from `main`, so a rollback runs the old image with the current compose file: see [Rollback across compose changes](#rollback-across-compose-changes).

## Setup

DigitalOcean: a container registry (`doctl registry create <name>`), then the Droplet and Komodo's first-time setup: [`deploy/README.md`](../deploy/README.md).

GitHub:

- Settings → Actions → General: allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests (release-please).
- Environment `production`: required reviewers, deployment branch `main`.
  - Secrets `KOMODO_API_KEY` and `KOMODO_API_SECRET`: the API key of Komodo service user `exam-platform-ci`.
  - Variable `KOMODO_URL`: `https://exam-platform.freecodecamp.dev`.
- Repository secret `DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN`: DigitalOcean token with registry read/write.
- Repository variables:
  - `DOCR_REGISTRY`: the registry name.
  - `PUBLIC_AUTH_API_URL`: the aAPI origin wApp's image bakes in.
- Branch protection: require `CI passed`. Release PRs opened with `GITHUB_TOKEN` trigger no CI, so either allow merging them without the check, or give release-please a GitHub App token.

The secrets and variables, with the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh secret set KOMODO_API_KEY --env production
gh secret set KOMODO_API_SECRET --env production
gh variable set KOMODO_URL --env production --body https://exam-platform.freecodecamp.dev
gh secret set DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN
gh variable set DOCR_REGISTRY --body <registry>
gh variable set PUBLIC_AUTH_API_URL --body <aAPI origin>
```

## DOCR username in Komodo

Before every pull, Komodo logs in to DOCR with an image registry account: a username plus a DigitalOcean token. Each stack names its account by username (`registry_account` in the sync file), and Periphery runs `docker login --username <username> --password-stdin registry.digitalocean.com` on the server.

- DigitalOcean documents two logins: the account email with an API token, or the token as both username and password. Whether DOCR accepts any other username, such as the placeholder `exam-platform`, is unverified.
- Never use the token as the username. `registry_account` is plain stack config: anyone with Read on the stack sees it, and the sync file is public.
- Test the username on the Droplet before configuring Komodo:

  ```bash
  read -rs DO_TOKEN # paste the token with registry read
  printf '%s' "$DO_TOKEN" | docker login registry.digitalocean.com --username exam-platform --password-stdin
  docker logout registry.digitalocean.com
  ```

  If DOCR rejects it, use the DigitalOcean account email instead. It ends up in this public repository, so prefer a team address.

- Changing it takes two edits: the account in Komodo (Settings → Providers), and `registry_account` in all four stacks in `deploy/exam-platform.toml`. Then run the sync.

## Rollback across compose changes

A deploy pairs two inputs from different places: the image digest from the Komodo Variable, and `compose.yaml` from `main` at the moment of the deploy. A rollback therefore runs the old image with the newest compose file. That works while the compose file changes only in ways the old image tolerates.

- Safe: adding environment variables (an image ignores those it does not read), labels, logging or resource limits; changing the restart policy or a published host port.
- Breaks the old image: renaming or removing a variable it still reads, or changing what one means; changing `LISTEN_ADDR`, the container port, `WEB_DIR` or another path baked into the image; dropping a network alias that another app, or Caddy, still calls.

Keep compose changes backward compatible for one release, as with database migrations: add, release, then remove in a later release. Commit them as `fix` or `feat` so they ship with the app's next release. A `chore` change sits on `main` until the app's next deploy, and that may be a rollback.

To roll back across an incompatible compose change:

1. Preferred: revert the compose change on `main`, then deploy `previous`.
2. Emergency: in Komodo, set the stack's Commit to the commit of the release being restored (GitHub tag `<app>-v<version>`), then deploy `previous`. Its `compose.yaml` matches the image again. Clear the Commit once `main` is fixed. Until then the sync reports the stack as changed, and running the sync reverts it to `main`.

## Later

- Staging: a second GitHub environment and Komodo server, promoting the same digest. wApp bakes `PUBLIC_AUTH_API_URL`, so its image stays per environment until it reads config at runtime.
- Public names for aAPI and wApp: a Caddy site block each ([`deploy/README.md`](../deploy/README.md#routing)).
- desktop-app: build and sign Tauri bundles in `release.yml`'s `desktop` job and attach them to the release.
- DOCR garbage collection for untagged manifests.
