| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **dApp**    | Serves exam content to the candidate and observes the station.                                                                                                                                                           |
| **wApp**    | Entrypoint for candidates to create accounts, verify identity, view certifications, and register for exams. Captures biometrics, and can operate as second proctoring device.                                            |
| **aAPI**    | Owns candidate identity and the attempt path. The only application candidate devices reach. Reads content through cAPI; writes attempts and evidence to mDb.                                                             |
| **cAPI**    | Sole holder of cDb credentials and sole writer of cDb. Fetches authored history from eDd's clone, fast-forwards `dev`, owns promotion, and serves redacted content to aAPI.                                              |
| **cDb**     | Exam content and its whole history. Self-hosted Dolt.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **mDb**     | Candidate identity, attempts, responses, and evidence. All candidate data.                                                                                                                                               |
| **eDd**     | Where examiners author, review, promote, and moderate. Owns examiner identity, roles, and scopes, and runs its own Dolt instance - the authoring clone - where all authoring happens. This is both a server and web-app. |
| **eDb**     | Everything eDd owns that is not versioned curriculum content.                                                                                                                                                            |
